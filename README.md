07-2D-Platformer

This is a project completed for C220 Game Technology at Indiana University. The purpose of the game was to create a 2D platformer game in Godot and written in GDScript. In this game, a bird is controlled using the arrow keys to move through clouds. The player must avoid enemy dragons shooting fire to get to the end of each of two levels. There are portals at the end of each level which transport the player either to the second level or the end screen. The game attempts to include a controlled player who can jump, more than one shooting enemy, a reported score, two levels, and a pause menu to stop and restart the game. 

After pulling your fixes, something happened when I reopened in Godot where the Github desktop did not track any of my changes and was no longer connecting to the correct respoitory. Basically, it was a mess, so I ended up making a new repository and uploading all of my newly edited files into it. Unfortunately, that means none of my history is present in this version, but you saw my previous version and I can resend that to you if you would like. 

The game is functionable, but there some existing problems such as the firing placement of the fire in level 2, the score resetting when level two begins, and quit restarting instead of quitting. I attempted to solve these problems, but couldn't find the underlyin issue and decided to just turn it in.
